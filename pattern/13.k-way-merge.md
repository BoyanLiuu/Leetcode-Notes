# 13.K-way merge

## Summary:

This pattern helps us solve problems that involve a list of sorted arrays. Whenever we are given ‘K’ sorted arrays, we can use a Heap to efficiently perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays. We can push the smallest \(first\) element of each sorted array in a Min Heap to get the overall minimum. While inserting elements to the Min Heap we keep track of which array the element came from. We can, then, remove the top element from the heap to get the smallest element and push the next element from the same array, to which this smallest element belonged, to the heap. We can repeat this process to make a sorted traversal of all elements.

* We usually use additional class object to keep track  which next class should we add

## Easy:

## Medium:

### [378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

* We can converted the matrix to multiple sorted lists. As each row \(or column\) of the given matrix can be seen as a sorted list, we essentially need to find the Kth smallest number in ‘N’ sorted lists.

### K Pairs with Largest Sums

#### 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums

* Given two sorted arrays in descending order, find ‘K’ pairs with the largest sum where each pair consists of numbers from both the arrays.

## Hard:

### [23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

```text
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
       PriorityQueue<ListNode> minHeap =  new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->a.val- b.val);
        
        for(ListNode cur  : lists){
            if (cur != null)
                minHeap.add(cur);
        }
        
        ListNode head =  new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode cur = head;
        
        while(!minHeap.isEmpty()){
            ListNode temp = minHeap.poll();
            cur.next = temp;
            cur = cur.next;
            if(temp.next != null)
                minHeap.add(temp.next);
   
        }
        
        return head.next;
        
    }
}
```

### Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists

Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, find the K’th smallest number among all the arrays.  

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2824%29.png)

* Same as Question 23

A big difference from Merge K Sorted Lists is that in this problem, the input is a list of arrays compared to LinkedLists. This means that when we want to push the next number in the heap we need to know what the index of the current number in the current array was. To handle this, we will need to keep track of the array and the element indices.

### [632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/)

* It has same idea as Merge K Sorted Lists
* We inserting the first number from all the arrays in a min-Heap, We will keep track of the largest number that we have inserted in the heap
* In a loop, we’ll take the smallest \(top\) element from the min-heap and currentMaxNumber has the largest element that we inserted in the heap. If these two numbers give us a smaller range, we’ll update our range. Finally, if the array of the top element has more elements, we’ll insert the next element to the heap.

## The Problems I struggle:

* 378, 略微有些变化
* 632 思路想出来了， 然后 需要自己写一遍
