# 15. Recursion

## Summary:

* Recursion occurs when a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a specified stopping condition
* For a recursive function, you only need to define the base case and recursive case, so the code is simpler and shorter than an iterative code. Recursion is most useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of _**similar subtasks**_.
* Three ways to divide a problem into sub problems:
  * Bottom Up Approach:
    * We start with knowing how to solve the problem for a simple case, like a list with only one element, Then we figure out how to solve the problem for two elements.   The key here is to think about how you can build the solution for one case off of the previous case 
  * Top-Down Approach:
    * It can be more complex since it is less concrete, Some times it is the best way to think about the problem In these problems, we think about how we can divide the problem for case N into subproblems. Be careful of overlap between the cases.
  * Half and Half Approach:
    * It is often effective to divide the data set in half. Such as binary search, we first figure out which half of the array contains the value. Then we recurse and search for it in that half

```text
    public static int gcd(int num1, int num2) {

        // Base case
        if (num1 == num2) {
            return num1;
        }
        // Recursive case
        if (num1 > num2) {
            return gcd(num1-num2, num2);
        }
        else {
            return gcd(num1, num2-num1);
        }
    }
