# General Utils

## Problem-solving process

* **Frequently criticize your understanding of the question**, always ask questions, and communicate with the interviewer to **confirm you have sufficient, accurate info** to solve the problem.  
* **Expand the problem and reveal the hidden messages**, like value boundaries, limitations, and many other edge cases you can think of.
* **Start with a simple, boring, or not much efficient solution** \(but it sure does the job, covering everything you need\),
  *  You can either **start coding it** if you are not confident about thinking of a better solution, 
    * discuss what to **improve your code** and how would it be better with the interviewer, of course, the main idea is about runtime and space, talk about how you improved your big O.
  * Or you can talk about this simple solution briefly if you already have a clear and better solution in your head, start implementing it. Then get straight to the structure of your better solution. 
* Always explain what are you doing when coding, too much silence is not very good. Explain why if necessary.
* Don't scare yourself if you make mistakes, admit it and analyze why it was wrong, talk about how can you improve it! This is always a good quality they would be looking for in an employer: calm, confident, honest, and logical.
* Try to keep your movement clean, trust me, people like that. Also, smile and be friendly.

## Common Mistakes \(Duh\)

* Last accumulated data:
  * Remember there can be a last accumulated data after the iteration, don't ignore it, it might be useful :\(

## Ivy's messed up syntaxes

*  **Max/Min value for Integer: `Integer.MAX_VALUE` / `Integer.MIN_VALUE`**
